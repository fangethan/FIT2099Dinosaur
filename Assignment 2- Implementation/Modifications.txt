Modifications 

Buy Action/ Vending Machine
The Buy action was not initiated by the player like the old sequence design. Instead it was called by the vending 
machine which checks to see if there is an instance of an actor nearby it and it then calls a buy action to initiate 
the player buying which item he wants. This was done to make the design more easier to understand as conceptually the 
vending machine allows players to buy items and such calls the buy class.

Added Probability class
This class creates a random variable between 0 to 1. This is used for the probability of new fruit growing as well as 
players harvesting food. THis was done as this can be used for multiple classes such as the bush class and tree class.

Added MealKit Class
This was used as a parent class for the vegetarian meal kit and the carnivore meal kit. This allowed both these to
 inherit the attributes of the parent class.
 
Added Egg Class
This was used as a parent class for the three types of eggs. This was essential as it allowed for inheritance 
of methods as well following the design principles.

BreedAction
The breed action now also contains a method called capability. This method is used to check the hasCapability 
of the actors and remove its attributes of either eligibleMale or eligibleFemale or add its attributes to pregnantFemale

BreedBehaviour, HuntBehaviour 
The breed behaviour and HuntBehaviour class although followed the design at the beginning by first getting all
 the x and y range to get all the actors, it then changes by needing a method called containsAnActor to see if 
the location at point (x,y) is an actor which can then be put in a list called dinosaurList. The class still gets
 the minimum distance but however does not use a while loop to get the dinosaurs to move together. Instead it does 
this in the super class of follow behaviour but it still checks if the target dinosaur is adjacent towards the moving dinosaur.
